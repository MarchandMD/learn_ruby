RSPEC

So, I feel like this is really exciting, interesting and important, and I want to make sure I have a good understanding of it. Despite it being a pretty heady thing, being meta programming. 

1. The exercise started in github where I forked a repo. Then I had to create a local repo, initialize with Git, and then clone the forked repo onto my machine....

2. After cloning the repo to my machine, I found a folder that contained a number of sub-directories. Which sub-directories were already there, and which were added during the completion of the setup of this repo/lesson?

the answer is: Everything in the learn_ruby file (aka, the forked and cloned repo from Github to my machine) was already there. 10 folders, and 7 files. the 10 folders are:

1. .bundle
2. 00_hello
3. 01_temperature
4. 02_calculator
5. 03_simon_says
6. 04_pig_latin
7. 05_book_titles
8. 06_timer
9. assets
10. spec

The files included are:
1. .gitignore
2. .rspec
3. Gemfile
4. Gemfile.lock
5. README.md
6. Rakefile
7. rspec_config.rb

Next, it's probably important to know what's in each of the lesson folders, because that's where I'm doing the actual work, and that's where the rspec tests are already existing. And I want to know HOW to write the TESTS because that's further down the road, and I want to know how to write those. I'm also concerned about Ruby being unnecssarily associated with Recursion, and that's the wrong idea. Ruby is a really simply, awesome language that I want to spend more time with. But I am avoiding the idea of recursion, since it is a difficult idea. So i should address that idea first...next...
